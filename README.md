## Tim's miscellaneous Stata bits and bobs

This is where I keep Stata related files – often things I am repeatedly sharing with people. I will try to keep the below list up to date.
* statanuggets.md contains bits and pieces I find useful but easily forget.
* loop-post.do is a brief introduction to looping and posting in Stata. It starts with something very simple and moves on to two more involved examples which should be a good skeleton for people to adapt, e.g. when running simulation studies.
* mollusc.do was the work of one lunch break. I saw someone post about 'mathematical art in R' so thought I would try and achieve one of the graphs there in Stata.
* covbias.do is a quick demo of the point that coverage reduces with n when you have a biased estimator (with caveat in commit description)
